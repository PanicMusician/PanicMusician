            <h2>Heywood</h2>
            <img src="heywood.jpg" class="article-image"/>
            <p>Heywood is what i would call the base block of Night City, because it is where most of night city sleeps. The norhtern part of distric is right next ot City Center so this part is well kept but moving southeast the scenery will dastricly change. the North has stunnig megabuilding and parks but the southeast is just more grimier and poorer than the North, but over all it is nice place to live and to visit as long as you don't anger the Valentinos or the Sixth street. </p>

            <img src="SantoDomingo.jpg" class="article-image"/>
            <p>Santo Domingo is one if not the oldest district in NC. Santo Domingo is the industrial hub of the city filled with corporate powerpants and manufacturing plants. We advise to not visit well becausethe isn't a lot of what o visit unless you like looking at factories but still be warned that the corporate security is really trigger happy so don't go to close.  </p>

            <h2>Pacifica</h2>
            <img src="Pacifica.jpg" class="article-image"/>
            <p>Pacifica could have been the place to visit becauseit was suposed to be Night City's own Las vegas with luxury hotels casinoes and an amusement park but that Pacifica only exist on blueprints in some corpo office waitng for fat-cat investors. All funding frothe Pacifica program was pull because of the unification war.</p><p>We heavily advice not to visit Pacifica do the rampant crime and aggressive gangs like the VoodooBoys and the animals and technicly Pacificais not part of NC do to it been rebranded as an indepentend discrit by the late Mayor of Night City.</p>
